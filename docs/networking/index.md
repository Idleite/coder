# Networking

Learn about Coder's networking stack.

## The basics

Coder leverages WireGuardÂ® tunnels to route traffic without requiring any ports open on clients (e.g. a developer's laptop) or workspaces (e.g. a Kubernetes pod). All clients and workspaces must be able to `curl` the Coder server address.

Even when a developer connects to a workspace via [VS Code Remote SSH](https://github.com/coder/vscode-coder), [JetBrains Gateway](https://github.com/coder/jetbrains-coder), or [coder ssh](../cli/ssh.md), port 22 does not have to be open on the workspace or the server. The traffic is routed through the Coder server through port 443.

> You can run the Coder server behind an ingress, reverse proxy, and/or LoadBalancer as long as WebSockets are supported.

## Direct connections

In some scenarios, a client can establish a direct "peer-to-peer" connection without traffic being routed through the Coder server. Here are the scenarios

- The client is connecting via SSH, not a web browser
- The client and Coder server has access to a STUN server
